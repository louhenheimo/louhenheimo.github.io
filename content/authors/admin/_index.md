Hello there! I'm a (friendly!) Systems Administrator, living in Kangasala, Finland. 

Communication sciences aficionado, especially UI/UX related stuff (well, human-technology interaction in general); also cloud stuff, privacy and societal resilience are what interests me most. Born in the distant 1970s when mobile phones were carried in briefcases and no-one would‚Äôve believed you can one day be your own ‚Äúbanker‚Äù by utilizing blockchain technology.

This site, Louhenheimo.com, is my personal internet diary, where I may rant about random things buggering my daily life. If you disagree about my point of view, or even want to feel like you‚Äôve been offended by my texts, I hope you have decency to be open about it and leave a comment. That way, we might come up with some sort of mutual understanding and in the end no-one really needs to get offended ‚Äì I hope! <3 üôÇ

*In the end, it‚Äôs not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away.*

‚ÄìXiong Sheng
