The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the stuff I use.

Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's Uses pages!

## Editor + Terminal

- Currently I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor
- Firefox is my main browser
- Alacritty (Linux) and PuTTY (Windows) are what I use for terminal

## Desktop Apps

- Logseq for keeping up my Personal Knowledge Management database
