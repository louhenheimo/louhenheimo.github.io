Greetings there! This is now officially my first posting to the Hive.blog (via my own website/blog at louhenheimo.com – hopefully the bridge I’m using does its magic and makes this work automatically).

I’m a tech-curious guy from Finland; currently aiming for a Master’s Degree in Technical Communication at my local university. I have to admit though that I’m not too familiar regarding the blockchain technology, or these “Web 3.0” platforms emerging around, but certainly I have become quite interested about what’s going to happen in this field. It also occured to me, that I might find my upcoming M.A thesis subject related to this phenomenon.

Other things I’m interested about include gaming (lately: EVE Online, Stellaris, Divinity: Original Sin -series — and am waiting eagerly the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077), UI/UX related stuff, and some (mainly front-end) programming, though wouldn’t dare to state having too much expertize in that field, yet!

If there is anything particular you would like to know about me or my life, feel free to reply this 🙂

Have a nice day, everyone!
